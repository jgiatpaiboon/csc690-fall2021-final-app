Name: James Giatpaiboon

CSC690 - 01: Final Project


Proposal: 

Sneaker informationapplication that allows user to view the sneaker's image, description, price, and two buttons that link to where you can purchase the sneaker. The main focus here is to make sure the application provides stories and much more details on the shoe unlike other apps that are already out.

Must have features:
-images for each shoe
-detailed description for each shoe
-retail price of each shoe,
-links for other apps such as StockX and GOAT where the user can purchase the shoe

Nice to have features:
-share sheet button so the user can share the link of the sneaker to other users
